# Bheithir

## What is Bheithir?
Bheithir is a program that sets Discord Rich Presence (RPC) status for [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/), a [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) emulator primarilly designed for playing games. In fact, rereleases of many popular DOS games, such as [*DOOM* (1993)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) and [*Duke Nukem 3D*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D), use DOSBox to run the games on PC. Bheithir uses [Lachee's C# Discord RPC](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) library to set RPC.

## How do I run it?
You can get the latest binary from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Bheithir/releases). Bheithir runs on it's own and is entirely seperate from DOSBox. **This is not a plugin. Bheithir works with all versions of DOSBox for Windows.**

## Is it functional?
At the moment it should be... Check the [issues](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Bheithir/issues) tab for any issues.

## What the hell is this name?
Since DOSBox an emulator for MS-DOS, an American operating system, I decided to go with a name influenced by British mythology and folklore, as America shares a lot with Britian culturally. Bheithir is a dragon who was though to be a representation of the [Celtic goddess of storms, winter, death, and darkness](https://books.google.com/books?id=XPoRSLTkhtsC&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=bheithir+scotland&source=bl&ots=h2FaVFtlKN&sig=ACfU3U0fPo-tvlrPfv6CW9OVvdrHlOE66g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKiInks77oAhWuGTQIHZbbAToQ6AEwCXoECB4QAQ#v=onepage&q=bheithir%20scotland&f=false). It is said it once resided in the Scottish mountain, [Beinn a' Bheithir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beinn_a%27_Bheithir), the Mountain of the Thunderbolt, where it was tricked and killed after terrorizing the villagers at the bottom of the mountain for a long time.

## When will this be done?
Well...it's functional, but it doesn't look the way I want it to or have all the features I want it to...so let's say it's *in progress*.

## Upcoming Features
- Idle status when not using a program (currently shows up as `DOSBOX`)
- A program icon
- Running as a system tray application so that it can update the background and you don't need to worry about it
- Support for other emulators

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to [BloodDragooner](https://github.com/BloodDragooner) for giving me the idea to this sort of thing with [SumatraPDF](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf)! A lot of code was borrowed from that project, Chilong, so check it out [here](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Chilong)!
